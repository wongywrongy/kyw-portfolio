# Individual Post Files Guide

This guide explains how to manage your blog content using individual post files - each post is now its own separate file for maximum flexibility and ease of editing.

## 📁 New Blog Structure

Your blog content is now organized with individual files:

```
src/content/blog/
├── index.ts                    # Main index file (combines all posts)
└── posts/
    ├── research/
    │   └── post-1.ts          # Individual research post
    └── blog/
    │   └── post-1.ts          # Individual blog post
    └── projects/
        └── post-1.ts          # Individual project post
```

## ✏️ Adding New Posts

### Step 1: Create a New Post File

**For Research Posts:**
Create a new file in `src/content/blog/posts/research/` (e.g., `post-2.ts`):

```typescript
export const post = {
  id: 3, // Use next available ID
  title: "Your New Research Post Title",
  excerpt: "Brief description of your research post...",
  category: "research", // Must be "research"
  date: "2024-01-30", // YYYY-MM-DD format
  readTime: "10 min read",
  tags: ["AI", "Machine Learning", "Research"],
  content: `
# Your Post Title

Your post content goes here. You can use markdown formatting.

## Section 1

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Section 2

- Point 1: Lorem ipsum
- Point 2: Dolor sit amet
- Point 3: Consectetur adipiscing

## Conclusion

Your conclusion here.
  `
}
```

**For Blog Posts:**
Create a new file in `src/content/blog/posts/blog/` (e.g., `post-2.ts`):

```typescript
export const post = {
  id: 4, // Use next available ID
  title: "Your New Blog Post Title",
  excerpt: "Brief description of your blog post...",
  category: "blog", // Must be "blog"
  date: "2024-01-25", // YYYY-MM-DD format
  readTime: "5 min read",
  tags: ["Web Development", "Technology"],
  content: `
# Your Blog Post Title

Your blog post content goes here.

## Introduction

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

## Main Content

Your main content here.

## Conclusion

Wrap up your thoughts.
  `
}
```

**For Project Posts:**
Create a new file in `src/content/blog/posts/projects/` (e.g., `post-2.ts`):

```typescript
export const post = {
  id: 5, // Use next available ID
  title: "Your New Project Title",
  excerpt: "Brief description of your project...",
  category: "projects", // Must be "projects"
  date: "2024-01-30", // YYYY-MM-DD format
  readTime: "6 min read",
  tags: ["React", "TypeScript", "Project"],
  content: `
# Your Project Title

Your project content goes here.

## Project Overview

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

## Technologies Used

- Technology 1: Description
- Technology 2: Description

## Key Features

- Feature 1: Description
- Feature 2: Description

## Results

Your project results and outcomes.
  `
}
```

### Step 2: Import the New Post

Edit `src/content/blog/index.ts` and add the import:

```typescript
// Import individual post files
import { post as researchPost1 } from './posts/research/post-1'
import { post as researchPost2 } from './posts/research/post-2' // Add this line
import { post as blogPost1 } from './posts/blog/post-1'
import { post as blogPost2 } from './posts/blog/post-2' // Add this line

// ... rest of the file ...

// Combine all posts from individual files
export const allPosts: BlogPost[] = [
  researchPost1,
  researchPost2, // Add this line
  blogPost1,
  blogPost2 // Add this line
].sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime())
```

## 🏷️ Post File Structure

Each post file exports a single object with these properties:

```typescript
{
  id: number,           // Unique identifier (required)
  title: string,        // Post title (required)
  excerpt: string,      // Brief description (required)
  category: string,     // "research" or "blog" (required)
  date: string,         // YYYY-MM-DD format (required)
  readTime: string,     // e.g., "5 min read" (required)
  tags: string[],       // Array of tags (required)
  content?: string      // Full post content in markdown (optional)
}
```

## 📝 Editing Existing Posts

### To Edit a Post:
1. Open the specific post file (e.g., `src/content/blog/posts/research/post-1.ts`)
2. Modify any property (title, excerpt, content, tags, etc.)
3. Save the file
4. Changes appear immediately on your website

### To Delete a Post:
1. Delete the post file
2. Remove the import from `src/content/blog/index.ts`
3. Remove the post from the `allPosts` array

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Individual Files**: Each post is its own TypeScript file
2. **Automatic Import**: Posts are imported and combined in `index.ts`
3. **Automatic Sorting**: Posts are sorted by date (newest first)
4. **Category Filtering**: Website automatically filters by category
5. **Hot Reload**: Changes appear immediately without restarting

## 📋 Example: Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Create a New Research Post

Create `src/content/blog/posts/research/post-2.ts`:

```typescript
export const post = {
  id: 3,
  title: "Advanced Neural Network Architectures",
  excerpt: "Exploring cutting-edge neural network designs and their applications.",
  category: "research",
  date: "2024-01-30",
  readTime: "15 min read",
  tags: ["Neural Networks", "AI", "Deep Learning"],
  content: `
# Advanced Neural Network Architectures

This post explores the latest developments in neural network design.

## Introduction

}
```

### Step 2: Update the Index File

Edit `src/content/blog/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Import individual post files
import { post as researchPost1 } from './posts/research/post-1'
import { post as researchPost2 } from './posts/research/post-2' // Add this
import { post as blogPost1 } from './posts/blog/post-1'

// ... rest of imports ...

// Combine all posts from individual files
export const allPosts: BlogPost[] = [
  researchPost1,
  researchPost2, // Add this
  blogPost1
].sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime())
```

### Step 3: View Results

- Save all files
- New post appears immediately on your website
- Automatically sorted by date
- Category filtering works immediately

## 🎯 Best Practices

### File Naming
- Use descriptive names: `post-1.ts`, `post-2.ts`, etc.
- Or use meaningful names: `machine-learning-autonomous-vehicles.ts`

### ID Management
- Use sequential IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Keep track of the highest ID used
- Don't reuse IDs

### Content Organization
- Keep related posts in the same category folder
- Use consistent formatting in your markdown content
- Include proper headings and structure

### Import Management
- Always add imports to `index.ts` when creating new posts
- Remove imports when deleting posts
- Keep the `allPosts` array in sync with imports

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Post Not Appearing
- Check that the file is imported in `index.ts`
- Verify the post is included in the `allPosts` array
- Ensure the ID is unique
- Check that the category matches exactly

### Import Errors
- Verify the file path is correct
- Check that the export name matches the import
- Ensure all required properties are included

### Content Not Updating
- Save all files (post file and index.ts)
- Check that the import is correct
- Verify the post is in the `allPosts` array

## 📚 Benefits of Individual Files

1. **Easy Editing**: Edit one post without affecting others
2. **Version Control**: Track changes to individual posts
3. **Organization**: Clear file structure by category
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add many posts
5. **Content Management**: Full post content in each file
6. **Flexibility**: Each post can have different structures

## 🔄 After Making Changes

1. Save the post file
2. Save the index.ts file (if you added imports)
3. Changes appear immediately in your browser
4. No need to restart the development server
5. All filtering and sorting works automatically

This individual file system gives you maximum flexibility and control over your blog content!
