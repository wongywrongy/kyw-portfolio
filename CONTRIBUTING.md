# Contributing to Agentic Project Management (APM)

Thank you for considering contributing to APM! Your contributions help build a better framework for AI-assisted project management.

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs & Workflow Issues

- **Search existing issues** first: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management/issues)
- **For new bug reports**, include:
  - APM version and setup method (template, clone, manual)
  - AI IDE used (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, etc.)
  - Specific agent type experiencing issues (Setup, Manager, Implementation, Ad-Hoc)
  - Step-by-step reproduction of the issue (if possible - otherwise a detailed description will suffice)
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Relevant context (memory system variant, asset format, etc.)

### Suggesting Features & Improvements

- Framework enhancements: New agent capabilities, workflow improvements, memory system optimizations
- Documentation improvements: Clearer explanations, additional examples, missing use cases
- New integrations: Support for additional AI IDEs, tools, or platforms
- Performance optimizations: Token efficiency, context management, handover procedures

**Before requesting new features or changes to workflow assets (prompts/guides):** Please review [Modifying_APM.md](docs/Modifying_APM.md) for guidance on customizing APM for your needs using a custom repo template.

### Documentation Contributions

APM v0.4 includes comprehensive documentation, and contributions to improve it are always welcome. Please note that documentation changes are treated with extra care to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency across the framework.

### High-Priority Areas Seeking Contributions:

**JSON Asset Format Testing**
- Experimental JSON variant for Implementation Plans, Memory Logs, and Task Assignments  
- Suitable for contributors with high token budgets or interest in structured asset validation
- Resources: 
  - [Context & Prompt Engineering](docs/Context_and_Prompt_Engineering.md) (background)
  - [`prompts/schemas/README.md`](prompts/schemas/README.md) (contribution guidelines)
- Contributions needed: Testing, feedback, schema improvements, validation scripts

**Ad-Hoc Delegation Guides**
- Specialized guides for context-intensive tasks beyond debugging and research
- Examples needed: Testing automation, security analysis, data extraction, documentation generation, performance optimization
- Resources: [`prompts/ad-hoc/README.md`](prompts/ad-hoc/README.md) (template patterns and guidelines)
- Format: Follow existing Debug/Research delegation guide structure

**Project Breakdown Procedure Optimization**
- Plans generated by the current guide are sufficient but can sometimes be inefficient. Seeking contributions to refine the Project Breakdown procedure and reduce token usage without sacrificing clarity or quality.
- Resources: [`prompts/guides/Project_Breakdown_Guide.md`](prompts/guides/Project_Breakdown_Guide.md), [`docs/Workflow_Overview.md`](docs/Workflow_Overview.md)
- Contributions needed: Lightweight patterns, guide refinements, practical examples, and validation benchmarks.

**AI IDE Platform Adaptations**

There are plans to expand APM’s reach by developing official **platform-specific adaptations** as independent repository forks. These adaptations are intended to take advantage of each platform’s unique features and address any platform-specific limitations, with the aim of providing a smoother and more effective user experience. The **main APM repository** will remain the IDE-agnostic, general-purpose framework, while these platform forks would function as **independent projects**. As such, they may not always incorporate every update, patch, or release from the main repository.

Current and planned target platforms for these adaptations include:
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- VS Code with AI extensions (Copilot, Roo, Cline etc.)

If you are interested in contributing to or collaborating on IDE adaptation work, please reach out via Discord at: `cobuter_man`.

### Community Contributions

- Share adaptations: Domain-specific customizations (web dev, data science, content creation)
- IDE integrations: Platform-specific rules, configurations, or workflows  
- Best practices: Cost optimization strategies, effective agent coordination patterns
- Case studies: Real project examples using APM
