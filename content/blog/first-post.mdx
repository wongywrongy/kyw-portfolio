# Building a Modern Portfolio with React and MDX

Creating a portfolio that's both beautiful and functional can be a challenging task. In this post, I'll walk through the process of building a modern portfolio using React, TypeScript, and MDX for content management.

## Why This Stack?

The choice of technology stack was driven by several key requirements:

- **Performance**: Fast loading times and smooth interactions
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update content and add new features
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript for type safety, MDX for rich content
- **Deployment**: Simple deployment to GitHub Pages

## Key Features

### 1. MDX Content Management

Using MDX allows us to write content in Markdown while still being able to use React components. This gives us the best of both worlds:

  MDX is incredibly powerful for content-heavy sites like portfolios and blogs.

```

### 2. Responsive Design

The portfolio is built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS:

<ImageGrid cols={2} gap="md">
  <img src="/sample-image-1.jpg" alt="Desktop view" />
  <img src="/sample-image-2.jpg" alt="Mobile view" />
</ImageGrid>

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- CSS-only animations for background effects
- Lazy loading of images
- Optimized bundle size with Vite

## Technical Implementation

The portfolio uses several key technologies:

- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **Radix UI**: For accessible components
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations

## Conclusion

Building a modern portfolio with React and MDX provides a great foundation for showcasing your work. The combination of type safety, rich content capabilities, and excellent developer experience makes it an ideal choice for developers.

The key is to focus on what matters most: your content and the user experience. With the right tools and a thoughtful approach, you can create something truly special.
