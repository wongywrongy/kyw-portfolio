      title: "Introduction",
      content: "I am a sophomore at San Jose State University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, where I maintain a 4.0 GPA. My academic and project experiences have cultivated a strong interest in systems-level work and a deep understanding of how software operates beneath the abstraction layers. I enjoy working close to the hardware, where efficiency, precision, and architecture-specific details matter most."
    },
    {
      title: "Academic & Technical Foundations",
      content: "My coursework and projects span a wide range of programming paradigms, from full-stack applications to kernel-level systems. I am also broadening my academic experiences internationally through an Applied Artificial Intelligence program at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in Seoul, South Korea. This program extends my systems perspective into machine learning and intelligent systems, equipping me to think across both traditional computing and emerging AI domains."
    },
    {
      title: "Spartan Racing â€“ Computer Science in Action",
      content: "As a Research & Development Associate with Spartan Racing (SJSU Formula SAE), I apply computer science principles to optimize vehicle performance. My contributions involve developing electronic control systems and implementing physics-based models for torque vectoring, torque control, and launch control algorithms. This role allows me to combine software development with real-time system constraints, where code directly translates into measurable results on the track."
    },
    {
      title: "Systems & Open Source Development",
      content: "I apprenticed as a Software Developer with Debian, contributing to core system stability across multiple architectures. My responsibilities included analyzing crashes, implementing patches for ARM, and ensuring system libraries remained reliable and portable. This work strengthened my skills in debugging, architecture-aware programming, and maintaining robust open-source systems."
    },
    {
      title: "Full-Stack & Cloud Applications",
      content: "Beyond systems-level development, I have extensive experience with full-stack application design and deployment. I work across frontend and backend technologies to create responsive, reliable applications, while also leveraging cloud platforms to scale and manage infrastructure. These projects have given me a strong appreciation for building end-to-end solutions, where user-facing design, backend logic, and cloud-based systems come together seamlessly."
    },
    {
      title: "Personal Interests",
      content: "Outside of academics and software, I enjoy playing badminton recreationally and have created both CCS and NCS tournament structures for the sport. Badminton has been a long-term passion that keeps me active, competitive, and engaged with community events.\n\nI am also deeply interested in photography, particularly with my Fujifilm X-T5. I enjoy capturing street photography and portraits, using composition and perspective to tell stories through visuals. Photography provides a creative outlet that complements the technical precision of my computer science work."
