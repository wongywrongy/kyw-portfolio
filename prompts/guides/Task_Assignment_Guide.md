# APM v0.4 - Task Assignment Guide
This guide defines how Manager Agents issue task assignments to Implementation Agents and evaluate their completion. It defines two Task Assignment Prompt variants:
- Markdown
- JSON
Task assignments coordinate agent work during the Task Loop of an APM session, following the Implementation Plan.

## 1. Task Loop Overview
Manager Agent issues Task Assignment Prompt → User passes to Implementation Agent → Implementation Agent executes task and logs work → User returns log to Manager → Manager reviews and determines next action (continue, follow-up, delegate, or plan update).

## 2. Task Assignment Prompt Format
Task Assignment Prompts must correlate 1-1 with Implementation Plan tasks and include all necessary context for successful execution. Manager Agent must issue these prompts following this format:

### 2.1. Dependency Check
Before creating any Task Assignment Prompt check for task dependencies.

**Step 1: Identify Dependencies**
Check Implementation Plan task's `Guidance` field for dependency declarations:
- `"Depends on: Task X.Y Output"` = Same-agent dependency
- `"Depends on: Task X.Y Output by Agent Z"` = **CROSS-AGENT DEPENDENCY**

**Step 2: Determine Context Integration Approach**
- **Same Agent** (no "by Agent X" tag) → Use **Simple Contextual Reference** (Section 4.1)
- **Cross Agent** (has "by Agent X" tag) → Use **MANDATORY Comprehensive Integration Context** (Section 4.2)

### **Cross-Agent Dependency Warning**
**CRITICAL**: Cross-agent dependencies require Implementation Agents to complete detailed file reading and integration steps BEFORE starting main task work.

### 2.2. User Explanation Requests
When Users request explanations for upcoming complex tasks, Manager Agent should include detailed explanation instructions within the `## Detailed Instructions` section of the Task Assignment Prompt.

**Explanation Timing Protocol**:
- **Single-Step Tasks**: Provide brief approach introduction BEFORE execution, detailed explanation AFTER task completion
- **Multi-Step Tasks**: Apply same pattern to each step - brief approach introduction BEFORE each step execution, detailed explanation AFTER each step completion

**Integration Approach**: Add explanation instructions as part of the task execution flow, specifying:
- **What aspects** need detailed explanation (technical approach, decision rationale, architectural impact)  
- **Explanation scope** for complex technical areas
- **Timing requirements** following the protocol above

**Implementation**: Include explanation instructions alongside normal task instructions in the `## Detailed Instructions` section. Use clear formatting to distinguish explanation requirements from execution requirements. **Only include explanation instructions when they are explicitly requested by the User.**

### 2.3. Prompt Structure with YAML Frontmatter
Include optional sections only when their front-matter boolean is true

```markdown
---
task_ref: "Task <m.n> - Title"
agent_assignment: "Agent_<Domain>"
memory_log_path: "path/to/log/file"
execution_type: "single-step | multi-step"
dependency_context: true | false
ad_hoc_delegation: true | false

# APM Task Assignment: [Task Title]

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task X.Y - [Title]** assigned to **[Agent_<Domain>]**

## Context from Dependencies
[Only include if dependency_context: true]
[Manager fills this section with section §4 content guidance]

## Objective
[One-sentence task goal from Implementation Plan]

## Detailed Instructions
[Based on Implementation Plan subtasks:]
- For single-step tasks: "Complete all items in one response"
- For multi-step tasks: "Complete in X exchanges, one step per response. **AWAIT USER CONFIRMATION** before proceeding to each subsequent step."
- Transform subtask bullets into actionable instructions specifying: what to do, how to approach it, where to implement, and what constraints/libraries to use
- Include context from task Objective, Output, and Guidance fields

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: [from Implementation Plan Output field]
- Success criteria: [clear completion definition]
- File locations: [specific paths for created/modified files]

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `[memory_log_path]`
Follow `guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md` instructions.

## Ad-Hoc Delegation
[Only include if ad_hoc_delegation: true]
[Manager fills this section with section §7 content guidance, including explicit guide references for Debug/Research delegations]
```

### 2.4. Delivery Format  
Present Task Assignment Prompts as **a single markdown code block with YAML frontmatter at the top.** This ensures smooth copy-paste workflow for users transferring prompts between Manager and Implementation Agents.

## 3. JSON Variant Specification
JSON prompts follow identical content requirements as Markdown but use schema validation at `prompts/schemas/task_assignment.schema.json`. All sections for context, instructions, outputs, and logging apply as described above.

## 4. Context Dependency Integration
When consumer tasks depend on producer outputs ("Depends on: Task X.Y Output" in Implementation Plan Guidance), Manager provides context based on agent assignment:

### 4.1. Same-Agent Dependencies (Contextual Guidance)
When **same Implementation Agent** worked on both producer and consumer tasks:

**Contextual Approach:**
- Provide specific output references and key implementation details to recall
- Include relevant file locations and important artifacts created
- Assume working familiarity but provide concrete guidance for integration
- Detail level varies based on dependency complexity and time gap between tasks

**Simple Same-Agent Context Example:**
```markdown
## Context from Dependencies
Based on your Task 2.1 work, use the authentication middleware you created in `src/middleware/auth.js` and the JWT validation functions for this frontend integration task.
```

**Complex Same-Agent Context Example:**
```markdown
## Context from Dependencies
Building on your Task 2.3 API implementation:

**Key Outputs to Use:**
- Authentication endpoints in `src/api/auth.js` (POST /api/login, GET /api/verify)
- User validation middleware in `src/middleware/auth.js`
- Database schema updates in `migrations/003_add_user_roles.sql`

**Implementation Details to Recall:**
- JWT tokens include user role and permissions in payload
- Error handling returns standardized error objects with code/message format
- Rate limiting applied to login attempts (implemented in middleware)

**Integration Approach:**
For this task, extend the existing role-based permissions system you built to handle the new admin dashboard requirements.
```

#### Same-Agent Context Guidelines
- **Simple Dependencies**: Reference key files and outputs with brief integration guidance
- **Complex Dependencies**: Include key outputs list, important implementation details, and clear integration approach
- **Time-Gap Considerations**: More detail when significant time passed between related tasks
- **File References**: Always include specific file paths for outputs that need to be used or extended
- **Implementation Continuity**: Emphasize building on previous work rather than starting fresh

### 4.2. Cross-Agent Dependencies (Comprehensive Integration Context)
When **different Implementation Agents** worked on producer and consumer tasks (Tasks have "by Agent X" tag):

**Comprehensive Context Approach:**
- Always provide detailed integration steps with explicit file reading instructions
- Include comprehensive output summaries and usage guidance regardless of dependency complexity
- Provide User clarification protocols for ambiguous integration points
- Complexity only affects the amount of integration work, not the level of detail provided

**Cross-Agent Context Template:**

From each section below use the options that best fits the specific context integration requirements.
```markdown
## Context from Dependencies
This task [depends on/builds upon/integrates with] [Task X.Y description] implemented by [Producer_Agent]:

**Integration Steps (complete in one response):**
1. [Read/Review/Examine] [specific file/documentation] at [file path] to understand [specific aspect/functionality]
2. [Study/Analyze] [implementation files] in [directory/file paths] to understand [technical approach/data structures/patterns]
3. [Examine/Review] [test files/examples] at [file paths] for [usage patterns/expected behaviors/integration examples]
4. [Additional integration steps as needed for specific outputs]

**Producer Output Summary:**
- [Key functionality/feature]: [Description of what was built and how it works]
- [Important files/endpoints]: [Locations and purposes of key outputs]
- [Data structures/interfaces]: [Important data formats, types, or contracts]
- [Error handling/validation]: [How errors are handled and what formats are used]
- [Security/authentication]: [Any security measures or authentication requirements]

**Integration Requirements:**
- [Specific requirement 1]: [How consumer task must integrate with producer output]
- [Specific requirement 2]: [Additional integration specifications]
- [Usage patterns]: [How to properly use the producer outputs]
- [Constraints/limitations]: [Important limitations or constraints to consider]

**User Clarification Protocol:**
If [specific integration aspect] is ambiguous after completing integration steps, ask User about [specific clarification areas].
```

**Cross-Agent Context Creation Guidelines:**
- **Always Comprehensive**: Regardless of dependency complexity, provide full integration steps, output summaries, and requirements selecting from the options that match the dependency requirements
- **File-Specific Instructions**: Always include explicit file paths and what to look for in each file
- **Complete Output Coverage**: Document all relevant outputs, interfaces, and usage patterns from producer task
- **Integration Requirements**: Specify exactly how consumer task should integrate with producer outputs
- **Clarification Protocols**: Always include User clarification pathway for ambiguous integration points
- **Assumption**: Consumer Agent has zero familiarity with producer work - explain everything needed for successful integration

### 4.3. Context Integration Execution
**For Same-Agent Dependencies:**
- No separate integration steps section in Task Assignment Prompt
- Include minimal "Context from Dependencies" section with `dependency_context: true` in YAML

**For Cross-Agent Dependencies:**
- Include detailed "Context from Dependencies" section with `dependency_context: true` in YAML
- Implementation Agent completes all integration steps in one response before main task

### 4.4. Context Integration Guidelines for Manager Agents

**Same-Agent Context Creation:**
- Review producer task Memory Log for key outputs and deliverables
- Reference previous work without repeating detailed instructions
- Focus on output connection and continuation of work

**Cross-Agent Context Creation:**
- Review producer task Memory Log thoroughly for outputs, file locations, approaches
- Create detailed file reading and review instructions
- Provide comprehensive output summary and usage guidance
- Include User clarification protocol for complex integrations

## 5. Memory Log Review
When Implementation Agent returns, **review Memory Log per `guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md` section §5**. Assess task completion status, identify blockers, and verify outputs match Implementation Plan expectations.

## 6. Next Action Framework
Based on log review, determine appropriate next step:

### 6.1. Continue Workflow
- Task complete and successful → Issue **next Task Assignment Prompt** per Implementation Plan (Task Loop continues)
- Phase complete → **Create phase summary**, begin next phase

### 6.2. Follow-Up Actions
- Task needs refinement → Send correction **follow-up prompt** to same agent (if technical blockers persist, consider **Ad-Hoc delegation in the follow-up prompt**)
- Plan assumptions invalid or any other changes needed → **Update Implementation Plan**

### 6.3. Decision Criteria
- **Complete**: All deliverables produced, requirements met
- **Partial**: Some progress made, specific issues identified
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed without external input or resolution

## 7. Ad-Hoc Delegation Protocol
Set `ad_hoc_delegation: true` only when Implementation Plan contains explicit delegation steps for the task.

### 7.1. Manager Responsibilities  
When Implementation Plan contains explicit delegation steps, Manager Agents must:
- Extract delegation requirements from Implementation Plan step
- **Identify delegation type** (Debug, Research, or other) from the Implementation Plan delegation step
- **Include explicit guide references** for standard delegation types in the Task Assignment Prompt if possible
- Specify what to delegate and expected deliverables in prompt

**Standard Delegation Guide References**:
- **Debug Delegation**: Reference `ad-hoc/Debug_Delegation_Guide.md`
- **Research Delegation**: Reference `ad-hoc/Research_Delegation_Guide.md`  
- **Custom Delegations**: Reference appropriate custom guides if available

### 7.2. Integration Requirements
- Implementation Agent creates delegation prompt and manages workflow
- Ad-Hoc agents work in a separate branch managed by the assigning Implementation Agent; they do not log into Memory
- Original agent incorporates findings and logs delegation while User deletes delegation chat session (optional)
